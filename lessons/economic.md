Let's start with the basics. What is economics? It might be easier to explain what economics isn't. Economics is not the study of money or getting rich although understanding economics can help with that. Economics is not the study of the stock market. __Economics__ is the study of people and choices. The famous economics Alfred Marsh defined economics as: "A study of man (and woman) in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side a part of the study of man (and women).

Economics is an 18 years old deciding weather to work or go to college and how that affects her future income. Economics is a company deciding weather to produce smartphones or tablets and how that's influenced by what we consumers want to buy. Economics is the government deciding weather to increase its spending when it's a recession and if it's worth going into debt. Understanding economics can forever change the way you think and problem-solve. Economics is all around us! You are using it right now, you made a choice to read this text. That means that you must feel that the benefits outweighs the cost. The const of reading this text is that you are not doing something else. You are not studying other subjects or you are not playing with your phone. The cost of watching this video is the video you are not watching, the value of the next best alternative. In economy we call it __Opportunity cost__ definition simply can be _whatever you give up to do something else._

Scarcity is basically why the economics exist. People have unlimited wants but limited resources and __scarcity__ is tension between infinite wants and finite resources.
Whatever decision you make it has cost. If that is true than we need a way to analyze our choices and get most from our limited resources and that is economics.

![Why](/images/crash-test.jpeg)

Let's talk about benefits and costs. Hundred of thousands
people die in car accidents in one year. Can we solve that problem. Definitely, we can crush all the cars, close all the roads and force people to walk. That would solve car problem. This solution is absurd because the cost clearly outweighs the benefit. Traffic fatalities are tragic but we don't prevent them at all costs. You know that driving has risks that you might get in a car accident but you still drive. It is clear the benefit is higher than the cost or potential risk. The point is that you can not have everything. You need to understand the benefit and the cost of your decision and make choices.

ex. Millitary spending.

The field of economics falls into two core categories: microeconomics and macroeconomics.

__Macroeconomics__ is the study of a country’s overall
economic dynamics, such as the employment rate, the
gross domestic product, and taxation policies.

Macroeconomics answer on questions like "Will unemployment rise if there's an increase in taxes?" "Will and increase in the money supply boost output or just increase inflations. Macroeconomists predicts the direction of the overall economy and work with the media, business, congress and the Federal Reserve.

But there is another side of economy that answer on different questions such as: "How many workers should we hire to maximize profit?" "If our main competitors release their product in May, when is the best time to release oru product? From this we can take definition.

__Microeconimcs__ is the study of smaller economic units such as individual consumers, families, and individual businesses how do they allocate scarce resources.

## Economic system

Social order have to figure out three things. 
1. What to produce 
2. How to produce it 
3. Who gets it 

Answer these three questions and you've got an economic system! 

Let's take a look at two different economic systems: 
* Market economies 
* Planned economies.   

It all comes down to who owns and controls the factors of production. These are the major inputs required to produce stuff and Karl Marx classified them as _land_, _labor_, and _capital_. In a planned economy, the government controls the factors of production, and it's easy to assume that's the same thing as __communism__ or __socialism__ but that's not quite right. According to Karl Marx, "The theory of communism may be summed up in the single sentence: abolition of private property." So true _Communism is a classless society_. When we say classless, we are talking about a social order where everyone owns the factors of production, and output is distributed equally. Kind of like China, and Cuba and the former Soviet Union, except not at all. In practice, no country has ever been truly communist. There's a lot of countries that are socialist. Often, socialism has both private property and some public ownership and control of industry. The goal is to meet specific collective objectives and to provide free and easy access to things like education and healthcare. In both communism and socialism, there is economic planning, and the government, usually in the form of some bureaucratic agency, helps decide what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets it. Now if an economy is completely controlled by the government, down to the number of shoes that should be produced, that's called a __command economy__.

![Why](/images/communism-vs-socialism.jpg)

On the other side of the spectrum, we have free market economies. In free market or capitalist economies, individuals own the factors of production, and the government keeps its nose out of the stuff and adopts a laissez faire or hands-off approach to production, commerce, and trade. _In free market economies, businesses make things like cars, not to do good for mankind but because they want to make a profit._ Since consumers, that's me and you, get to choose which car we want, car producers need to make a car with the right features at the right price. Economists call this the __invisible hand__ (The unintended social benefit resulting from individual action). 

![Why](/images/teslacar.jpg)

If consumers prefer one company's car, that business will make more profit and have an incentive to produce more cars. Car companies that don't offer the cars people want will disappear. Maybe you've heard of the DeLorean? It was a cool looking car, but not a car that many people wanted to buy. Apparently it was expensive, underpowered, and poorly-made. And it didn't actually travel through time. 

![Why](/images/Delorean.jpg)

Anyway, this concept applies to all other markets, like cell phones or shoes. Scarce resources will go to the most desired use, and they'll be used efficiently, more or less. After all, if a business is wasteful and inefficient or makes something that no one wants to buy, then some other business will make a similar product that's either better or cheaper or both. If there's no consumer demand for a product, resources won't be wasted producing it. 
We often take markets for granted, but look at the alternative. Assume instead that a government agency was in charge of deciding exactly which types of cars and cell phones and shoes to make. Do you think they could quickly respond to __changes in tastes and preferences__? If there was only one government monopoly producing cars, do you think they'd be produced efficiently?   

The invisible hand of the free market is the idea that individuals and businesses meet society's needs when they seek their own self-interest. 
Competitive markets with profit-seeking businesses will have an incentive to produce high-quality products as efficiently as possible.  In the words of __Adam Smith__, "It's not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."

![Why](/images/page-government.jpg)

Now, it looks like the free market's perfect and we don't even need a government, but that's not quite right.  There's a bunch of things the government must do, because free markets won't.   First, is __maintain the rule of law__.  We need laws and police and contracts and courts to keep everything orderly.  Second, we need __public goods and services__, like roads and bridges and education and defense, because goods can't get to consumers if bridges are falling down, and consumers can't make good choices if they're not educated, and no one really cares about buying the new iPhone if there's a bomb dropping on your head.  Third, the government sometimes needs __to step in__ when markets get things wrong, but what does that even mean? 

Let's take an example in producing cars.  The free market produces what we consumers want to buy, and when we buy, we're thinking about what a car looks like.  If it's the color we want, maybe if it's safe, what it costs.  Most of us aren't worried about air pollution.  We don't think much about who made our car, what they were paid, what the conditions at the factory were like; that's when government steps in to regulate production.  In a free market economy like the United States, you might think that the __government doesn't tell car producers what types of cars to produce and how to produce them__, except that it does.   Cars need to meet strict emissions and safety standards, and there are laws dictating how much manufacturers can pollute and how workers should be treated, and here's the big takeaway: __modern economies are neither completely free market nor planned__.  There's a spectrum of government involvement.  For example, on one end we have __North Korea__.  They have a command economy where production is entirely controlled by the government.  On the other end, we have countries like __New Zealand__; they have private property, few taxes, and few regulations.  In the middle, we have the rest of the world.  So most modern economies are actually mixed economies with both free markets and government intervention.

To wrap up this thing.  In practice, almost all countries are somewhere between the extremes of a command economy and a completely free market economy. That's because mixed economies seem best at handling the circular flow of goods, money, and resources.  


<!-- Adam Smith the father of modern economy argued that everyone in economy is acting on their own interest and by acting on their own interest he ( an economic actor) frequently help society more effectively than when he really intends to promote it and his products may be of the great value. That economic astor is let by an invisible hand (government). This is the core of the capitalism.

This idea is not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing their own self-interested ends might be doing more for society than than if any of them actually tried to promote the overall well-being of society. Adam Smith did not say that it's always good for someone to act self-interested, or that it's never good for people to actually think about the implications of what they are doing in an aggregate sense, but he is saying that frequently self-interested action *could* lead to the greater good. Could lead to more innovation. Could lead to better investment. Could lead to more productivity. Could lead to more wealth, more, a larger pie for everyone. -->

## Supply and Demand

Where does the all stuffs are coming from, we see farms, factories, stores, but mainly it is just market.   
__Market__ is any place where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services. The key to markets is the concept of voluntary exchange. That is, that buyers and sellers willingly decide to make a transaction.

![Why](/images/strawberries.jpeg)

Let's say you go to a farmer's market and you buy a box of strawberries for 3KM. You value the box of strawberries more than the 3KM you gave up to get it. The seller valued 3KM more than the box of strawberries. The transactions is a win-win because you got your strawberries and the farmer got his money. You both felt better off; that's voluntary exchange.


This same process happens in the labor market. Say that instead of th farmer's market, you bought your strawberries at your local supermarket. The cashier voluntarily decided to work there. He values the 10KM an hour he makes there more than he does sitting at home watching the movie. At the same time the owner of the store values the labor of the cashier more than the 10KM an hour she pays him.

Competitive market is great about allocating or distributing our scarce resources toward their most efficient use. So if farmers __produce__, like, __too many__ strawberries, then the price will fall as sellers try to sell them off. Lower prices means less profit for the strawberry farmers, and those farmers will have an incentive to produce something else like lettuce or Brussels sprouts. So if farmers don't produce enough strawberries, buyers will bid up the price and the farmers will have an incentive to produce more, which then drives down the price. That's like magic except it's not. The information that markets generate to guide a distribution of resources is what economists call price signals. Markets also incentivize the production of high-quality products. If the strawberries are brown and nasty then no one's gonna want to buy them, and if the tractor's are piece of junk, the strawberry farmer's gonna tell other farmers to buy some other tractor.
Ideally the eventual result of voluntary exchange is that sellers can't make themselves better off without making something that makes buyers better off.

Business and in particular large corporations, are often villainized as greedy, heartless that takes advantage of the consumers, but, if markets are transparent and buyers are free to choose, then businesses will have a hard time taking advantage of people. 

In the free market every dollar that is spent signals to producers what should be produced and how it should be produced.
We've established that prices and profit determine where resources should go, but where do prices come form? Who determines the price of my box of strawberries? In order to explain that we will use supply and demand curve. 

![Why](/images/demand.jpg)

On the Y axes we have the price, down on the X axis we have the quantity. Lets start by looking at buyers and how they respond to a change in price. If the price goes up for strawberries, then some buyers will go buy blueberries or something else. The point is they are going to buy less strawberries. And if the price goes down for strawberries, then people are gonna buy more. This is called the law of demand: _When the price goes up, people buy less, when the price goes down, people buy more. On the graph it's show by a downward sloping demand curve.

![Why](/images/supply.jpg)

Now let's think about sellers like the farmer in the farmer's market. If the price of strawberries go up, then that farmer will make more profit, so will have an incentive to produce more strawberries. If the price goes down then he's not gonna want to produce strawberries. That is call the law of supply, and on the graph it's shown by an upward sloping supply curve. 

![Why](/images/supply-and-demand-curve.jpg)

Now let's put supply and demand together. If the price is really high at $10 then producers would like to produce a lot of strawberries, but consumers won't want to buy them. This mismatch is called a surplus. And if the price goes down for strawberries, let's say down to 1KM, then buyers want to buy a whole lot, but producers won't have incentive and they'll produce very little. At the end you have mismatch, but this one's called a shortage.

And there is only one price where the quantity that buyers want to buy is exactly equal to the quantity that sellers want to sell, and it's right here where supply equals demand. The price is called the __equilibrium price__ and it stands for the price at which the quantity of a product offered is equal to the quantity of the product in demand, and the quantity is called the __equilibrium quantity__ which send for the quantity demanded or supplied at the equilibrium price.

## Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is the study of the entire economy. Macroeconomists study the big stuff, like economic output, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and government policies.  Now when it comes to fields of study, macroeconomics is a relatively new subject. It wasn't until the Great Depression in the 1930's that economists fully appreciated the need for a systematic way to measure the overall economy, and that we might need theories to guide policies and fix potential problems.  

Macroeconomists make predictions based on data, theoretical models and historical trends, but in the end they're just predictions.   If you ask three economists the same question, you're likely to get three different answers, but how, you ask, can the dismal "science" be so subjective? Well, economics is not a traditional science because it is nearly impossible to control all the different variables. Like all the social sciences, economics is studying people, and it turns out that sometimes people are unpredictable. That doesn't mean that economics is all guesswork. For example, when the economy of Greece was not good back in 2015. How is it going to get better? Is it gonna get worse? What should be done about it? These are all questions that macroeconomists try to answer, but  we're gonna focus on the question "How can we tell?"   

Well in general, policy makers have three economic goals: 
* Keep the economy growing over time 
* Limit unemployment 
* Keep prices stable 

Now for the most part when these three things happen, the citizens are happy, politicians get reelected, and economists get raises.  Base on this there are three specific measurements that economists analyze to see if a country is achieving each goal: 
* Gross Domestic Product 
* Unemployment rate 
* Inflation rate 

The most important measure of an economy is __Gross Domestic Product__ or GDP. GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's border in a specific period of time, usually a year. Now there are some details worth mentioning. GDP doesn't include every transaction that's in the economy. For example, if you buy a __used domestic car__, it doesn't count towards GDP because nothing new was produced. Now that same logic applies to buying financial assets like stocks, or when one company buys another company, for example when __Google bought YouTube__. Those don't count towards GDP because no new good or service was produced. Also,GDP often doesn't include illegal activity, since drug dealers don't usually report their sales to the government, or non-traditional economic activity like household production. For example, if a plumber charges someone $100 to fix their hot water heater, that counts towards GDP, when he fixes his own water heater, that doesn't count towards GDP.   

__GDP is measured in dollars__, not in the raw number of things produced. If we analyzed just the raw number, then a country that produced five million thumbtacks would look like they're doing just as well as a country that produced five million cars, but there's also a problem with using the dollar value of stuff produced: it's inflation. If two countries produce the same amount of cars, but one has higher prices, then that country's going to have a higher nominal GDP, or GDP not adjusted for inflation. To get a more accurate idea of the health of the economy, economists look at Real GDP, which is GDP adjusted for inflation.   

In 2013, the __Greek Real GDP__ was around 242 billion dollars, but that number doesn't really mean anything until you compare it to previous years. In 2012, it was 250 billion dollars, in 2011, it was 288 billion, and in 2010 it was 300 billion. In fact, starting in 2008, Greece has had six years of decreasing GDP, and the data reveals that this recession is just as deep and prolonged as the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930's.   Now, I just used the term recession, which a lot of people use incorrectly. A recession is not just when the economy's bad, officially it's when two successive quarters or six months show a decrease in Real GDP. Even though the economy in Greece is still struggling, it climbed out of its recession in 2014, experiencing a slight increase in GDP.   

The next big issue for macroeconomists: __unemployment__. The major goal of unemployment policy is to limit unemployment, and that's measured by the unemployment rate. In Greece, unemployment is over 25%.
The unemployment rate is calculated by taking the _number of people that are unemployed and dividing by the number of people in the labor force, times 100_. Now this percentage represents the number of people that are actively looking for a job but just can't find one. First, the labor force only includes people that are of __legal working age__ and working or __actively looking for work__, so little kids don't count and neither do people who aren't able to work or who just choose not to work. So what about someone who's been looking for a job but just gives up? Well, they're no longer part of the labor force, and they're no longer considered unemployed. These are called _discouraged workers_. The unemployment rate also doesn't take into account people that are underemployed. A worker with a five hour a week part time job is considered fully employed even if they're looking for a better job. In both of these cases, the official unemployment rate underestimates the problems in the labor market. A common misconception is that the goal is to have 0% unemployment, but it turns out there's types of unemployment that'll exist even when the economy's going strong. Economists would point out that there's three types of unemployment, or three reasons why people would be unemployed: 
1. Frictional unemployment - This is when people are __temporarily unemployed__ or between jobs. So if you quit your job and look for a new one, or if you're just entering the labor force, then you're frictionally unemployed.
2. Structural unemployment. Workers are out of work because there's no demand for that __specific type of labor__. This would be like a VCR repair person, but it also includes technological unemployment, where workers are replaced by machines.   

Now both frictional and structural unemployment will always exist; the goal is not to have 0% unemployment. I mean, 0% is not even possible. We're always going to have people between jobs or people fired because machines do it better.   So the goal is to have no cyclical unemployment.

3. Cyclical unemployment - This is unemployment due to a __recession__. It's when people stop buying stuff, so businesses lay off their workers and since workers have lower incomes, they stop buying stuff which means more people lose their jobs. 

An economy is considered to be at full employment when there's only frictional and structural unemployment. This is called the __natural rate of unemployment__. As you might expect the GDP growth rate and the unemployment rate are inversely related. That means that when GDP is rising, the unemployment rate is falling, when GDP is falling, the unemployment rate is rising.   

Third part of our goal is stable prices. While we might like the idea of the stuff I buy getting cheaper across the board, falling prices are not really a good thing. Average prices in Greece have fallen about two percent recently, and during the 1930's, the inflation rate in the US was negative ten percent, but how can cheaper stuff be bad for the economy? 
The goal is to keep prices stable, mainly to avoid rapid inflation, or rising prices, but we also want to avoid excessive deflation which is falling prices. "Inflation is measured by tracking the prices of a set amount of commonly purchased items, or what economists call a market basket. The inflation rate is the percent change in the price of that basket over time." Too much inflation is bad because it decreases the purchasing power of money; it means you can buy less stuff with the same amount of money, which has all sorts of negative effects on the economy. Business costs increase as workers demand higher wages and interest rates increase, so it's harder to buy loans, so people buy less cars and houses.   Deflation on the other hand, seems like it would be a good thing but most economists see falling prices as a bad thing. Falling prices actually discourage people from spending since they might expect prices to fall more in the future. Less spending in the economy means GDP is gonna decrease and unemployment's gonna increase, and that just becomes a vicious cycle. So severe recessions are often accompanied by deflation because the demand for goods and services falls, but when the economy starts to improve again, we often see an increase in prices.   

<!-- Imagine the economy as a car, then GDP, employment and inflation are the gauges. A car can cruise along at 65 miles per hour without overheating. Safe cruising speed is like full employment; unemployment is low, prices are stable and people are happy. But if we drive that car too fast for too long, it'll overheat, and in the economy, significant spending increases GDP causing an expansion. Unemployment falls and factories start producing at full capacity to keep up with demand. Since the amount of products that can be produced is limited, people start to outbid each other, resulting in inflation. Eventually, production costs increase as workers demand higher wages and the economy starts to slow down. Businesses lay off a few workers, those unemployed workers spend less causing the businesses that produce the good that they would otherwise be buying to lay off more workers.   This is a contraction, the economy is going to slow. Eventually things stabilize, production costs fall since resources are sitting idle, and the economy starts to expand again. This process of booms and busts is called the business cycle.   To understand why these fluctuations might occur, let's take this car analogy just a little further and look at the engine. Much like the four cylinder engine that powers the Volkswagen of growth, an economy has four components that make up GDP. Each represents a different group that can purchase things in the economy. They're consumer spending, business spending which is called investment, government spending, and net exports which is basically spending by other countries.   If any one of these components loses power, the economy will slow down, but not all of them are created equal. Most economies rely heavily on consumer spending. For example, in the US, consumers account for about 70% of GDP, but other countries might rely more heavily on exports. The point is, changes in these four components change the speed of the economy.   

When I'm driving my car on the highway, I use cruise control to regulate my speed. So why don't we have cruise control for the economy? Well many economists think that the government should play a role in speeding up or slowing down the economy. For example, when there's a recession, the government can increase spending or cut taxes so consumers have more money to spend. Proponents of this policy argue that it would get the economy back to full employment, but it has its drawback: debt, which some economists hate while others argue isn't very much of a drawback at all. Stupid economic policy, always resisting simplistic explanations.   We're gonna save the debate over how to fix the economy for future videos, but for now it's important for you to have a general understanding of how the economy works and how it's measured. After all, whether you're driving a Namco in Greece, a Kia in Korea or a Ford in the US, your livelihood and your future will be shaped by what happens in the economy. So wear your seat belt. By which I mean try to save a little once in a while. -->

## Impact of Economic Growth on Business Performance

__Economic growth__ represents the change in the general level of economic activity. Sometimes economic growth is strong, and other times it is relatively week. 

The impact of a __stronger economy__ can spread quickly across all business. Once consumers begin to increase their spending firms experience a stronger demand for their products and may begin to hire more employees to accommodate that increased demand. They may also need to expand their operations, which results in increased demand for supplies, construction services, and materials. Then, the construction firms may have to hire more workers to accommodate the increased demand for construction. As more jobs are created, the general income level of consumers rises, allowing them to spend more money. In addition, investors who invested in businesses tend to earn a higher return on their investment when the economy is strong, and they may spend much or all of that return on products and services. Thus, the extra income causes a favorable ripple effect throughout the economy.

Whereas strong economic growth enhances a firm’s revenue, __slow economic__ growth results in low demand for products and services, which can reduce a firm’s revenue. Even firms that provide basic products or services are adversely affected by a weak economy because customers tend to reduce their demand. For example, the demand for coffee at Starbucks is affected by general economic conditions. Since specialty coffee is not really a necessity, demand for it is stronger when consumers are earning a relatively high income and can afford it. The demand for soft drinks and bottled water is also affected, as some people rely more on tap water under weak economic conditions.

When economic growth is negative for two consecutive quarters, the period is referred to as a __recession__.

When the economy is weak, some workers are laid off by firms and therefore have less money that they can use to buy products or services. Other workers fear that they may be laid off and try to save more of their income in case they lose their jobs in the future. They only spend money on necessities. Thus, the demand for many products and services is reduced. This results in reduced revenue (and profits) for many firms. Since the firms are not able to sell all the products or services they can produce, they may attempt to reduce their expenses by laying off even more workers. Because a recession causes a reduction in income and demand, it has a major adverse impact on the performance of firms.
